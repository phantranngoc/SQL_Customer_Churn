1. Compare the quantity of orders in different years.
2. Determine the client group with the greatest financial loss due to orders not being translated into invoices. 

3. Review customer turnover (# customer churn) by monthly, quarterly, and monthly.

The SQL functions are used to solve the questions described above.
